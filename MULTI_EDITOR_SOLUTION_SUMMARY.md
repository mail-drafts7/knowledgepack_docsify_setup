# Multi-Editor Content Management Solution

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Original Issues:**
- Multiple editors directly updating files in Netlify CMS without review
- No conflict resolution mechanism
- No review process for content changes
- Risk of overwriting each other's work

**Solution Implemented:**
- Editorial workflow with pull request-based reviews
- Automated conflict detection and resolution guidance
- GitHub Actions for content validation and preview
- Comprehensive documentation and setup scripts

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Netlify CMS with Editorial Workflow**
   - `publish_mode: editorial_workflow` enables draft → review → publish flow
   - Changes create branches instead of direct commits
   - Built-in preview functionality

2. **GitHub Actions Workflows**
   - `content-review.yml`: Validates content, creates previews, auto-merges
   - `conflict-resolution.yml`: Detects conflicts, provides guidance

3. **Branch Protection Rules**
   - Requires pull request reviews
   - Requires passing status checks
   - Prevents direct pushes to main branch

4. **Automated Conflict Resolution**
   - Detects merge conflicts automatically
   - Provides step-by-step resolution guidance
   - Labels PRs for easy identification
