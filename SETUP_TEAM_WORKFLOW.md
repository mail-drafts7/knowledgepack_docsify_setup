- All changes require review

### 2. Team Organization

Consider creating GitHub teams:
- `@content-editors`: All content creators
- `@content-reviewers`: Senior editors and reviewers
- `@site-admins`: Technical administrators

## üéØ Netlify Configuration

### 1. Netlify Site Settings

In your Netlify dashboard:

**Build & Deploy:**
- Build command: `npm run build` (if applicable)
- Publish directory: `./` (root directory for Docsify)

**Deploy contexts:**
- Production branch: `main`
- Branch deploys: **All branches** (for preview)
- Deploy previews: **Any pull request against main**

### 2. Identity & Git Gateway

**Enable Identity:**
1. Go to **Site settings ‚Üí Identity**
2. Click **Enable Identity**
3. Set registration preferences (invite only recommended)

**Configure Git Gateway:**

BRANCH=main
```

## üìù CMS Configuration Validation

Verify your `admin/config.yml` contains:

```yaml
backend:
  name: git-gateway
  branch: main

# This is crucial for the review workflow
publish_mode: editorial_workflow

# Enable previews
editor:
  preview: true

# Site configuration
site_url: https://your-site.netlify.app
display_url: https://your-site.netlify.app
```

3. Verify backup and recovery procedures

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

### GitHub Actions Not Running

**Issue:** Workflows don't trigger
**Solution:**
- Check Actions are enabled in repository settings
- Verify workflow files are in `.github/workflows/`
- Check branch protection rules don't block Actions

### CMS Can't Save Content

**Issue:** "Error persisting entry in git repo"
**Solution:**
- Verify Git Gateway is properly configured
- Check GitHub OAuth app permissions
- Ensure user has repository write access

### Branch Protection Too Strict

**Issue:** Even admins can't merge
**Solution:**
- Temporarily disable "Include administrators"
- Make necessary changes
- Re-enable protection rules

### Conflict Resolution Confusion

**Issue:** Team doesn't understand conflict resolution
**Solution:**
- Provide hands-on training session
- Create video walkthrough
- Assign conflict resolution buddy system

## üìä Monitoring and Maintenance

### Weekly Maintenance Tasks

- [ ] Update documentation as needed
- [ ] Review and optimize workflows
- [ ] Backup content and configuration

### Performance Metrics

Track these metrics for workflow success:

- Number of merge conflicts per month
- PR approval time
- Content editor satisfaction scores

## üîÑ Workflow Optimization Tips

### For Large Teams (10+ editors)

1. **Content Ownership Matrix**: Assign specific files/sections to editors
2. **Time Slots**: Coordinate editing schedules
3. **Multiple Reviewers**: Require 2+ approvals for major changes
4. **Automated Assignment**: Use GitHub's auto-assignment features

### For Frequent Updates

1. **Batch Reviews**: Schedule regular review sessions
2. **Priority Labels**: Use labels to prioritize urgent content
3. **Fast-Track Process**: Create expedited approval for urgent fixes

### For Complex Content

1. **Preview Environments**: Set up staging environments
2. **Content Templates**: Create templates for common content types
3. **Style Guides**: Maintain consistent content standards

## üìû Support and Help

### Internal Support

- **Technical Issues**: Contact site administrators
- **Content Questions**: Reach out to content team leads
- **Process Issues**: Review documentation or ask in team chat
